### Logical Operators
- & -> AND
- | -> OR
- ^ -> XOR
- || -> Short-circuit OR
    - If first element is True, already returns True, no need to check both
- && -> Short-circuit AND
    - Performs a modulus operation, checks for divison by zero error, etc. (faster) and if the first element is false, automatic fail
- ! -> NOT
